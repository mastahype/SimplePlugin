SimplePlugin for MacOS 10.9 (Mail.app 7.0)

I spent two days for searching the solution for "WorkedFineOnLionAndMountainLion.mailbundle failed to load. The error was:
Error Domain=NSCocoaErrorDomain Code=3588 and put to garbage". Users of my plugin says "you are really the goat!!!".

Really thanks for project GPGMail https://github.com/GPGTools/GPGMail.

Code contain only base steps for build your oun Mail.app plugin. It done for answering the question 
"Why, Why this piece of ~~f*ck~~ code not worked on 10.9" and for every little ~~noob~~ beginner MacOS dev practice in build own plugin.
